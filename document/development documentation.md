The framework I adopted for this challenge is React Native. And I applied other third-party services such as Firebase, Alpha Vantage and Algolia. Check out the main feature demo video in [folder](https://github.com/XuetingWu46/S8/blob/main/User%20Manual.md). Part of screenshots will be shown next.



## Code Design & Structure
There are 4 directories in the _src_ directory of project.   <br>
1. **assets**: This directory mainly contains some auxiliary objects. For example, the pictures used in the program and the data needed to configure the use of other third-party services.<br> 
2. **constants**ï¼š It contains global variables. Any other javascript file can share its data.<br> 
3. **navigation**: This includes the code implementation and logic of navigation and routes of whole project. <br> 
4. **screens**: The implementation of each functional screen.
